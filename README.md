# Rule Engine

## Introduction

# Requiremets

The system manages facts on each table. The facts, as the name suggests, are data points. Each fact is a string, int, Boolean or date. Those facts are not good nor bad, but just a recording of the current state of the table. Later the facts are evaluated by the rule engine who analyzes the current status, raises alerts and makes recommendations.
